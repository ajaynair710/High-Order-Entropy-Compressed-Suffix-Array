# High-Order Entropy-Compressed Suffix Array (CSA)

This project implements a compressed suffix array (CSA) with high-order entropy compression for efficient text indexing. The goal is to provide a Python-based CSA with locate queries in (log n)^Îµ time per occurrence.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.py` to build the CSA and benchmark its performance.
